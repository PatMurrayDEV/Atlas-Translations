# Atlas Translations
XLIFF files for Atlas Wallpaper.

These are xliff files that can be edited in any xliff editor. The comments leave a lot to be desired, sorry -- if you have any questions DM me on twitter @\_patmurray. 

If you can translate to a langauge I've not included let me know and I'll add it too. 

Let me know if this works. Hopefully it should be pretty quick ðŸ˜€ as there's not too many words. Please try to keep the string length as close as possible but obviously that isn't feasible in some languages. 


Cheers,
Patrick
